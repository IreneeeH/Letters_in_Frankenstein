I am by birth a Genevese; and my family is one of the most distinguished,1,7,15
of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and,1,6,12
syndics; and my father had filled several public situations with honour,1,4,11
and reputation. He was respected by all who knew him for his integrity,1,7,13
and indefatigable attention to public business. He passed his younger,1,7,10
days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country; and it was not,1,4,13
"until the decline of life that he thought of marrying, and bestowing on",1,6,13
the state sons who might carry his virtues and his name down to,1,4,13
posterity.,1,1,1
"As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot",1,5,11
"When I had attained the age of seventeen, my parents resolved that I",2,11,13
should become a student at the university of Ingolstadt. I had hitherto,2,6,12
"attended the schools of Geneva; but my father thought it necessary, for",2,8,12
"the completion of my education, that I should be made acquainted with",2,6,12
other customs than those of my native country. My departure was,2,5,11
"therefore fixed at an early date; but, before the day resolved upon",2,11,12
"could arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurred—an omen, as it",2,6,13
"were, of my future misery.",2,4,5
"Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; but her illness was not severe,",2,11,12
"and she quickly recovered. During her confinement, many arguments had",2,8,10
"From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the",3,2,10
"most comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.",3,11,11
"I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination,",3,3,12
which modern inquirers have written on these subjects. I attended the,3,10,11
"lectures, and cultivated the acquaintance, of the men of science of the",3,10,12
university; and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense,3,9,14
"and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive physiognomy",3,5,11
"and manners, but not on that account the less valuable. In M. Waldman I",3,4,14
found a true friend. His gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism; and,3,8,12
"his instructions were given with an air of frankness and good nature,",3,5,12
"It was on a dreary night of November, that I beheld the accomplishment",4,7,13
"of my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected",4,4,13
"the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being",4,6,14
into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in the,4,8,15
"morning; the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was",4,6,12
"nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I",4,7,13
"saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a",4,10,14
convulsive motion agitated its limbs.,4,2,5
"How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the",4,8,13
wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form?,4,6,13
Clerval then put the following letter into my hands.,5,5,9
“_To_ V. FRANKENSTEIN.,5,2,3
"“MY DEAR COUSIN,",5,1,3
“I cannot describe to you the uneasiness we have all felt concerning,5,9,12
your health. We cannot help imagining that your friend Clerval conceals,5,6,11
the extent of your disorder: for it is now several months since we have,5,9,14
seen your hand-writing; and all this time you have been obliged to,5,7,13
"dictate your letters to Henry. Surely, Victor, you must have been",5,8,11
"exceedingly ill; and this makes us all very wretched, as much so nearly",5,8,13
as after the death of your dear mother. My uncle was almost persuaded,5,8,13
"On my return, I found the following letter from my father:—",6,5,11
“_To_ V. FRANKENSTEIN.,6,2,3
"“MY DEAR VICTOR,",6,1,3
“You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of,6,7,13
"your return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few lines,",6,6,16
merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you. But that would,6,6,13
"be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it. What would be your surprise,",6,6,15
"my son, when you expected a happy and gay welcome, to behold, on the",6,8,14
"contrary, tears and wretchedness? And how, Victor, can I relate our",6,6,11
misfortune? Absence cannot have rendered you callous to our joys and,6,7,11
"We passed a few sad hours, until eleven o’clock, when the trial was to",7,8,15
commence. My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend,7,9,13
"as witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of this",7,7,13
"wretched mockery of justice, I suffered living torture. It was to be",7,8,12
"decided, whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would",7,9,11
"cause the death of two of my fellow-beings: one a smiling babe, full of",7,7,15
"innocence and joy; the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every",7,10,11
aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.,7,5,11
"Justine also was a girl of merit, and possessed qualities which promised",7,6,12
to render her life happy: now all was to be obliterated in an,7,7,13
"Nothing is more painful to the human mind, than, after the feelings have",8,7,13
"been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of",8,9,13
"inaction and certainty which follows, and deprives the soul both of hope",8,5,12
and fear. Justine died; she rested; and I was alive. The blood flowed,8,9,13
"freely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my",8,9,14
"heart, which nothing could remove. Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered",8,10,12
"like an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond",8,7,12
"description horrible, and more, much more, (I persuaded myself) was yet",8,8,11
"behind. Yet my heart overflowed with kindness, and the love of virtue. I",8,9,13
"had begun life with benevolent intentions, and thirsted for the moment",8,9,11
"The next day, contrary to the prognostications of our guides, was fine,",9,5,12
"although clouded. We visited the source of the Arveiron, and rode about",9,8,12
the valley until evening. These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded,9,11,10
me the greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving. They,9,8,11
elevated me from all littleness of feeling; and although they did not,9,9,12
"remove my grief, they subdued and tranquillized it. In some degree,",9,10,11
"also, they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded",9,6,13
"for the last month. I returned in the evening, fatigued, but less",9,8,12
"unhappy, and conversed with my family with more cheerfulness than had",9,6,11
"been my custom for some time. My father was pleased, and Elizabeth",9,9,12
“It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original æra of,10,6,12
my being: all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.,10,7,12
"A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard,",10,7,12
"and smelt, at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I",10,9,15
learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses. By,10,9,11
"degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I",10,11,13
"was obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness then came over me, and troubled",10,9,13
"me; but hardly had I felt this, when, by opening my eyes, as I now",10,6,15
"suppose, the light poured in upon me again. I walked, and, I believe,",10,8,13
descended; but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations.,10,8,11
"“I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep. I thought of the occurrences",11,5,15
of the day. What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these,11,9,13
"people; and I longed to join them, but dared not. I remembered too well",11,10,14
the treatment I had suffered the night before from the barbarous,11,9,11
"villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I might hereafter",11,9,10
"think it right to pursue, that for the present I would remain quietly in",11,6,14
"my hovel, watching, and endeavouring to discover the motives which",11,6,10
influenced their actions.,11,3,3
“The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun. The young woman,11,9,12
"arranged the cottage, and prepared the food; and the youth departed",11,9,11
“I now hasten to the more moving part of my story. I shall relate events,12,7,15
"that impressed me with feelings which, from what I was, have made me",12,8,13
what I am.,12,0,3
"“Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine, and the skies",12,9,10
"cloudless. It surprised me, that what before was desert and gloomy",12,7,11
should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure. My senses,12,7,12
"were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight, and a",12,8,12
thousand sights of beauty.,12,1,4
"“It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested from",12,8,13
"labour—the old man played on his guitar, and the children listened to",12,6,13
“Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends. It was,13,10,13
"one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding",13,5,13
as it did a number of circumstances each interesting and wonderful to,13,6,12
one so utterly inexperienced as I was.,13,6,7
“The name of the old man was De Lacey. He was descended from a good,13,9,15
"family in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence,",13,8,12
"respected by his superiors, and beloved by his equals. His son was bred",13,8,13
in the service of his country; and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the,13,6,14
"highest distinction. A few months before my arrival, they had lived in a",13,6,13
"large and luxurious city, called Paris, surrounded by friends, and",13,4,10
“Such was the history of my beloved cottagers. It impressed me deeply. I,14,9,13
"learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire",14,9,12
"their virtues, and to deprecate the vices of mankind.",14,7,9
“As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil; benevolence and,14,8,12
"generosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to",14,14,12
become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities were,14,11,13
"called forth and displayed. But, in giving an account of the progress of",14,4,13
"my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred in the",14,5,12
beginning of the month of August of the same year.,14,5,10
"“One night, during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood, where I",14,6,12
"“Cursed, cursed creator! Why did I live? Why, in that instant, did I not",15,4,14
extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed? I,15,7,12
know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my feelings were,15,9,13
those of rage and revenge. I could with pleasure have destroyed the,15,11,12
"cottage and its inhabitants, and have glutted myself with their shrieks",15,6,11
and misery.,15,1,2
"“When night came, I quitted my retreat, and wandered in the wood; and",15,8,13
"now, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my",15,8,14
anguish in fearful howlings. I was like a wild beast that had broken the,15,5,14
"toils; destroying the objects that obstructed me, and ranging through",15,5,10
"The being finished speaking, and fixed his looks upon me in expectation",16,8,12
"of a reply. But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to arrange my",16,9,13
ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition. He,16,7,11
continued—,16,1,1
"“You must create a female for me, with whom I can live in the",16,7,14
interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being. This you alone,16,8,11
can do; and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse.”,16,3,16
The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had,16,8,15
"died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and,",16,9,12
"as he said this, I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within",16,6,14
"Day after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and",17,10,14
I could not collect the courage to recommence my work. I feared the,17,9,13
"vengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my",17,10,12
repugnance to the task which was enjoined me. I found that I could not,17,6,14
compose a female without again devoting several months to profound study,17,6,11
and laborious disquisition. I had heard of some discoveries having been,17,6,11
"made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was material to",17,7,12
"my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my father’s consent to",17,5,13
"visit England for this purpose; but I clung to every pretence of delay,",17,8,13
"and could not resolve to interrupt my returning tranquillity. My health,",17,5,11
London was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several,18,10,12
months in this wonderful and celebrated city. Clerval desired the,18,8,10
intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this time;,18,8,13
but this was with me a secondary object; I was principally occupied with,18,4,13
the means of obtaining the information necessary for the completion of,18,7,11
"my promise, and quickly availed myself of the letters of introduction",18,6,11
"that I had brought with me, addressed to the most distinguished natural",18,5,12
philosophers.,18,1,1
"If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness,",18,4,13
it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But a blight had come,18,9,12
"I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was",19,6,15
"just rising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment,",19,5,13
"and I remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should",19,7,13
"leave my labour for the night, or hasten its conclusion by an",19,4,12
"unremitting attention to it. As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to",19,5,13
"me, which led me to consider the effects of what I was now doing. Three",19,9,15
"years before I was engaged in the same manner, and had created a fiend",19,11,14
"whose unparalleled barbarity had desolated my heart, and filled it for",19,7,11
"ever with the bitterest remorse. I was now about to form another being,",19,9,13
of whose dispositions I was alike ignorant; she might become ten,19,6,11
"I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old",20,7,12
"benevolent man, with calm and mild manners. He looked upon me, however,",20,9,12
"with some degree of severity; and then, turning towards my conductors,",20,7,11
he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.,20,6,9
About half a dozen men came forward; and one being selected by the,20,9,13
"magistrate, he deposed, that he had been out fishing the night before",20,10,12
"with his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o’clock,",20,5,14
"they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put",20,5,11
"in for port. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen;",20,4,16
"they did not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a",20,6,15
"We had resolved not to go to London, but to cross the country to",21,4,14
"Portsmouth, and thence to embark for Havre. I preferred this plan",21,7,11
principally because I dreaded to see again those places in which I had,21,8,13
enjoyed a few moments of tranquillity with my beloved Clerval. I thought,21,7,12
with horror of seeing again those persons whom we had been accustomed to,21,8,13
"visit together, and who might make inquiries concerning an event, the",21,8,11
very remembrance of which made me again feel the pang I endured when I,21,12,14
gazed on his lifeless form in the inn at ——.,21,4,9
"As for my father, his desires and exertions were bounded to the again",21,9,13
seeing me restored to health and peace of mind. His tenderness and,21,11,12
It was eight o’clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the,22,8,16
"shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn, and",22,7,12
"contemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured",22,8,10
"in darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines.",22,4,8
"The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence in",22,7,14
"the west. The moon had reached her summit in the heavens, and was",22,9,13
beginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight,22,7,12
"of the vulture, and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the scene",22,13,13
"of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves that",22,11,12
were beginning to rise. Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.,22,9,11
My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was,23,3,11
swallowed up and lost. I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone endowed,23,8,13
"me with strength and composure; it modelled my feelings, and allowed me",23,9,12
"to be calculating and calm, at periods when otherwise delirium or death",23,7,12
would have been my portion.,23,3,5
"My first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when",23,6,13
"I was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became",23,7,14
"hateful. I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few",23,7,13
"jewels which had belonged to my mother, and departed.",23,7,9
"And now my wanderings began, which are to cease but with life. I have",23,7,14
